# Library

A PWA to display your images in a gallery, made with Angular.

## Prerequisites

`npm` is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.
To install node.js:

```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nodejs

```

Install Angular CLI:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The npm start command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into dist/, watches for changes to the source files, and runs live-server.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Firebase (for web)
